## Exploring Climate Change Communications
I created this Shiny app to explore a subset of the publicly available Yale Climate Change Communications data from 2023. I created three interactive plots to visualize the data and encourage viewers to consider different variables either over geographic regions, over time, or in relation to another variable. All of the code was written in R.
