# Who is Andrea Conover?
Hi! I'm Andrea, a mixed methods social scientist. My research interests revolve around human-environment interactions, particularly perceptions of urban-wildlands boundaries. I'm currently an MA candidate at the University of Chicago through their Master's Program in the Social Sciences, currently on track for degree completion in early June, 2025. My thesis, "Competing Discourses in News Coverage of the 2024 Bridge Fire", examines conflicts of sensationalism vs. rationalism and human dominance vs. untameable nature in the coverage of southern California wildfires. See ["About"](https://andreaconover.github.io/about.html) for more details of my teaching and work experience!


# Projects
This website includes a portfolio of projects I completed during my MA program. These projects were completed using R, Plotly, Shiny, Tableau, and QGIS, and many are generally related to general climate change or environmental issues.
